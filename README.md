# A small app built while growing skills using React, React-Router and Redux


A shoutout to the folks who made the the [React Router Tutorial](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial).

Shout out to @wesbos for his [Learn Redux](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux-Starter-Files/tree/master/learn-redux) tutorial series.
(Tutorial Videos found one [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5uyzEWxdlr9WQTJJIzr6jy).)

This app is mostly both of what was built in the *React Router Tutorial* merged with the *Learn Redux* tutorial so that in the end I have an app that uses React, React Router and Redux. I've been wanting to look into these various technologies for a while and this app is the result of my fiddling about. Enjoy!

To load the app first run clone then `cd` into the root of the project and run
```sh
$ npm install
```
Then start the app:

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

And go to *localhost:8080*
